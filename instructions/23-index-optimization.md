# Optimize an Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL container's indexing policy for common operations

For write-heavy workloads or workloads with large JSON objects, it can be advantageous to optimize the indexing policy to only index properties that you know you will want to use in your queries.

In this lab, we will use a test .NET application to insert a large JSON item into an Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL container using the default indexing policy, and then using an indexing policy that has been tuned slightly.

## Prepare your development environment

If you have not already cloned the lab code repository for **DP-420** to the environment where you're working on this lab, follow these steps to do so. Otherwise, open the previously cloned folder in **Visual Studio Code**.

1. Start **Visual Studio Code**.

    > &#128221; If you are not already familiar with the Visual Studio Code interface, review the [Getting Started documentation][code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted]

1. Open the command palette and run **Git: Clone** to clone the ``https://github.com/microsoftlearning/dp-420-cosmos-db-dev`` GitHub repository in a local folder of your choice.

    > &#128161; You can use the **CTRL+SHIFT+P** keyboard shortcut to open the command palette.

1. Once the repository has been cloned, open the local folder you selected in **Visual Studio Code**.

## Create an Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL account

Azure Cosmos DB is a cloud-based NoSQL database service that supports multiple APIs. When provisioning an Azure Cosmos DB account for the first time, you will select which of the APIs you want the account to support (for example, **Mongo API** or **NOSQL API**). Once the Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL account is done provisioning, you can retrieve the endpoint and key and use them to connect to the Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL account using the Azure SDK for .NET or any other SDK of your choice.

1. In a new web browser window or tab, navigate to the Azure portal (``portal.azure.com``).

1. Sign into the portal using the Microsoft credentials associated with your subscription.

1. Select **+ Create a resource**, search for *Cosmos DB*, and then create a new **Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL** account resource with the following settings, leaving all remaining settings to their default values:

    | **Setting** | **Value** |
    | ---: | :--- |
    | **Subscription** | *Your existing Azure subscription* |
    | **Resource group** | *Select an existing or create a new resource group* |
    | **Account Name** | *Enter a globally unique name* |
    | **Location** | *Choose any available region* |
    | **Capacity mode** | *Serverless* |

    > &#128221; Your lab environments may have restrictions preventing you from creating a new resource group. If that is the case, use the existing pre-created resource group.

1. Wait for the deployment task to complete before continuing with this task.

1. Go to the newly created **Azure Cosmos DB** account resource and navigate to the **Data Explorer** pane.

1. In the **Data Explorer** pane, select **New Container**.

1. In the **New Container** popup, enter the following values for each setting, and then select **OK**:

    | **Setting** | **Value** |
    | --: | :-- |
    | **Database id** | *Create new* &vert; *cosmicworks* |
    | **Container id** | *products* |
    | **Partition key** | */categoryId* |

1. Back in the **Data Explorer** pane, expand the **cosmicworks** database node and then observe the **products** container node within the hierarchy.

1. In the resource blade, navigate to the **Keys** pane.

1. This pane contains the connection details and credentials necessary to connect to the account from the SDK. Specifically:

    1. Record the value of the **URI** field. You will use this **endpoint** value later in this exercise.

    1. Record the value of the **PRIMARY KEY** field. You will use this **key** value later in this exercise.

1. Close your web browser window or tab.

## Run the test .NET application using the default indexing policy

This lab has a pre-built test .NET application that will take a large JSON object and create a new item in the Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL container. Once the single write operation is complete, the application will output the itemâ€™s unique identifier and RU charge to the console window.

1. In **Visual Studio Code**, in the **Explorer** pane, browse to the **23-index-optimization** folder.

1. Open the context menu for the **23-index-optimization** folder and then select **Open in Integrated Terminal** to open a new terminal instance.

    > &#128221; This command will open the terminal with the starting directory already set to the **23-index-optimization** folder.

1. Build the project using the [dotnet build][docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-build] command:

    ```
    dotnet build
    ```

    > &#128221; You may see a compiler warning that the **endpoint** and **key** variables are current unused. You can safely ignore this warning as you will use these variable in this task.

1. Close the integrated terminal.

1. Open the **script.cs** code file.

1. Locate the **string** variable named **endpoint**. Set its value to the **endpoint** of the Azure Cosmos DB account you created earlier.
  
    ```
    string endpoint = "<cosmos-endpoint>";
    ```

    > &#128221; For example, if your endpoint is: **https&shy;://dp420.documents.azure.com:443/**, then the C# statement would be: **string endpoint = "https&shy;://dp420.documents.azure.com:443/";**.

1. Locate the **string** variable named **key**. Set its value to the **key** of the Azure Cosmos DB account you created earlier.

    ```
    string key = "<cosmos-key>";
    ```

    > &#128221; For example, if your key is: **fDR2ci9QgkdkvERTQ==**, then the C# statement would be: **string key = "fDR2ci9QgkdkvERTQ==";**.

1. **Save** the **script.cs** code file.

1. In **Visual Studio Code**, open the context menu for the **23-index-optimization** folder and then select **Open in Integrated Terminal** to open a new terminal instance.

1. Build and run the project using the **[dotnet run][docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-run]** command:

    ```
    dotnet run
    ```

1. Observe the output from the terminal. The item's unique identifier and the operation's request charge (in RUs) should be printed to the console.

1. Build and run the project at least two more times using the **[dotnet run][docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-run]** command. Observe the RU charge in the console output:

    ```
    dotnet run
    ```

1. Leave the integrated terminal open.

    > &#128221; You will re-use this terminal later in this exercise. It's important to leave the terminal open so you can compare the original and updated RU charges.

## Update the indexing policy and rerun the .NET application

This lab scenario will assume that our future queries focus primarily on the name and categoryName properties. To optimize for our large JSON item, you will exclude all other fields from the index by creating an indexing policy that starts by excluding all paths. Then the policy will selectively include specific paths.

1. In a new web browser window or tab, navigate to the Azure portal (``portal.azure.com``).

1. Sign into the portal using the Microsoft credentials associated with your subscription.

1. Select **Resource groups**, then select the resource group you created or viewed earlier in this lab, and then select the **Azure Cosmos DB account** resource you created in this lab.

1. Within the **Azure Cosmos DB** account resource, navigate to the **Data Explorer** pane.

1. In the **Data Explorer**, expand the **cosmicworks** database node, expand the **products** container node, and then select **Settings**.

1. In the **Settings** tab, navigate to the **Indexing Policy** section.

1. Observe the default indexing policy:

    ```
    {
      "indexingMode": "consistent",
      "automatic": true,
      "includedPaths": [
        {
          "path": "/*"
        }
      ],
      "excludedPaths": [
        {
          "path": "/\"_etag\"/?"
        }
      ]
    }    
    ```

1. Replace the indexing policy with this modified JSON object and then **Save** the changes:

    ```
    {
      "indexingMode": "consistent",
      "automatic": true,
      "includedPaths": [
        {
          "path": "/name/?"
        },
        {
          "path": "/categoryName/?"
        }
      ],
      "excludedPaths": [
        {
          "path": "/*"
        },
        {
          "path": "/\"_etag\"/?"
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

1. Close your web browser window or tab.

1. Return to **Visual Studio Code**. Return to the open terminal.

1. Build and run the project at least two more times using the **[dotnet run][docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-run]** command. Observe the new RU charge in the console output, which should be significantly less than the original charge:

    ```
    dotnet run
    ```

    > &#128221; If you are not seeing an updated RU charge, you may need to wait a couple of minutes.

1. In a new web browser window or tab, navigate to the Azure portal (``portal.azure.com``).

1. Sign into the portal using the Microsoft credentials associated with your subscription.

1. Select **Resource groups**, then select the resource group you created or viewed earlier in this lab, and then select the **Azure Cosmos DB account** resource you created in this lab.

1. Within the **Azure Cosmos DB** account resource, navigate to the **Data Explorer** pane.

1. In the **Data Explorer**, expand the **cosmicworks** database node, expand the **products** container node, and then select **Settings**.

1. In the **Settings** tab, navigate to the **Indexing Policy** section.

1. Replace the indexing policy with this modified JSON object and then **Save** the changes:

    ```
    {
      "indexingMode": "none"
    }
    ```

1. Close your web browser window or tab.

1. Return to **Visual Studio Code**. Return to the open terminal.

1. Build and run the project at least two more times using the **[dotnet run][docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-run]** command. Observe the new RU charge in the console output, which should be slightly less than the original charge:

    ```
    dotnet run
    ```

    > &#128221; If you are not seeing an updated RU charge, you may need to wait a couple of minutes.

1. Close **Visual Studio Code**.
