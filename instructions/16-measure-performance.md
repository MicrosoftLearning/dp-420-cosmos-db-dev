# Measure performance for customer entities

In this exercise, you'll measure the difference for customer entities when you model entities as separate containers versus when you model for a NoSQL database by embedding entities in a single document.

## Prepare your development environment

If you have not already cloned the lab code repository for **DP-420** to the environment where you're working on this lab, follow these steps to do so. Otherwise, open the previously cloned folder in **Visual Studio Code**.

1. Start **Visual Studio Code**.

    > &#128221; If you are not already familiar with the Visual Studio Code interface, review the [Get Started guide for Visual Studio Code][code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted]

1. Open the command palette and run **Git: Clone** to clone the ``https://github.com/microsoftlearning/dp-420-cosmos-db-dev`` GitHub repository in a local folder of your choice.

    > &#128161; You can use the **CTRL+SHIFT+P** keyboard shortcut to open the command palette.

1. Once the repository has been cloned, open the local folder you selected in **Visual Studio Code**.

1. In **Visual Studio Code**, in the **Explorer** pane, browse to the **16-measure-performance** folder.

1. Open the context menu for the **16-measure-performance** folder and then select **Open in Integrated Terminal** to open a new terminal instance.

1. If the terminal opens as a **Windows Powershell** terminal, open a new **Git Bash** terminal.

    > &#128161; To open a **Git Bash** terminal, on the right hand side of the the terminal menu,click on the pulldown besides the **+** sign and choose *Git Bash*.

1. In the **Git Bash terminal**, run the following commands. The commands open a browser window to connect to the azure portal where you will use the provided lab credentials, run a script that creates a new Azure Cosmos DB account, and then build and start the app you use to populate the database and complete the exercises. *Once you have entered the provided credential for the azure account, the build may take 15-20 minutes to complete, so it might be a good time to get some coffee or tea*.

    ```
    az login
    cd 16-measure-performance
    bash init.sh
    dotnet add package Microsoft.Azure.Cosmos --version 3.22.1
    dotnet build
    dotnet run --load-data

    ```

1. Close the integrated terminal.

## Measure performance of entities in separate containers

In Database-v1, data is stored in individual containers. In that database, run queries to get the customer, customer address, and customer password. Review the request charge for each of those queries.

### Query for customer entity

In Database-v1, run a query to get the customer entity and review the request charge.

1. In a new web browser window or tab, navigate to the Azure portal (``portal.azure.com``).

1. Sign into the portal using the Microsoft credentials associated with your subscription.

1. On the Azure portal menu, or from the **Home** page, select **Azure Cosmos DB**.
1. Select the Azure Cosmos DB account with the name that starts with **cosmicworks**.
1. Select **Data Explorer** on the left side.
1. Expand **Database-v1**.
1. Select the **Customer** container.
1. At the top of the screen, select **New SQL Query**.
1. Copy and paste the following SQL text and then select **Execute Query**.

    ```
    SELECT * FROM c WHERE c.id = "FFD0DD37-1F0E-4E2E-8FAC-EAF45B0E9447"
    ```

1. Select the **Query Stats** tab and note the request charge of 2.83.

### Query for customer address

Run a query to get the customer address entity and review the request charge.

1. Select the **CustomerAddress** container.
1. At the top of the screen, select **New SQL Query**.
1. Copy and paste the following SQL text and then select **Execute Query**.

    ```
    SELECT * FROM c WHERE c.customerId = "FFD0DD37-1F0E-4E2E-8FAC-EAF45B0E9447"
    ```

1. Select the **Query Stats** tab and note the request charge of 2.83.

### Query for customer password

Run a query to get the customer password entity and review the request charge.

1. Select the **CustomerPassword** container.
1. At the top of the screen, select **New SQL Query**.
1. Copy and paste the following SQL text and then select **Execute Query**.

    ```
    SELECT * FROM c WHERE c.id = "FFD0DD37-1F0E-4E2E-8FAC-EAF45B0E9447"
    ```

1. Select the **Query Stats** tab and note the request charge of 2.83.

    ![Screenshot that shows the query stats for customer password query in the database.](media/17-customer-password-query-v1.png)

### Add up the request charges

Now that we've run all of our queries, let's add up all of the Request Unit costs for them.

|**Query**|**RU/s cost**|
|---------|---------|
|Customer|2.83|
|Customer Address|2.83|
|Customer Password|2.83|
|**Total RU/s**|**8.49**|

## Measure performance of embedded entities

Now we're going to query for the same information but with the entities embedded in a single document.

1. Select the **Database-v2** database.
1. Select the **Customer** container.
1. Run the following query. 

    ```
    SELECT * FROM c WHERE c.id = "FFD0DD37-1F0E-4E2E-8FAC-EAF45B0E9447"
    ```

1. Observe that the data coming back is now a hierarchy of customer, address, and password data.

    ![Screenshot that shows the query results for customer in the database.](media/17-customer-query-v2.png)

1. Select **Query Stats**. Note the request charge of 2.83, versus the 8.49 RU/s for the three queries that you ran earlier.

## Compare the performance of the two models

When you compare the RU/s for each query that you ran, you see that the last query where the customer entities are in a single document is much less expensive than the combined cost for running the three queries independently. The latency for returning this data is lower because the data is returned in a single operation.

When you're searching for a single item and know the partition key and ID of the data, you can retrieve this data via a *point-read* by calling `ReadItemAsync()` in the Azure Cosmos DB SDK. A point-read is even faster than our query. For the same customer data, the cost is just 1 RU/s, which is a nearly threefold improvement.
