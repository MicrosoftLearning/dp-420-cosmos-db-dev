# Execute a query with the Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL SDK

The latest version of the .NET SDK for the Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL makes it easier than ever to query a container and asynchronously iterate over result sets using the latest best practices and language features from C#.

> &#128161; This lab uses the *4.0.0-preview3* release of the [Azure.Cosmos][nuget.org/packages/azure.cosmos/4.0.0-preview3] library on NuGet. This library has special functionality to make it easier to query Azure Cosmos DB using [asynchronous streams][docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/csharp/whats-new/csharp-8#asynchronous-streams].

In this lab, you'll use an asynchronous stream to iterate over a large result set returned from Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL. You will use the .NET SDK to query and iterate over results.

## Prepare your development environment

If you have not already cloned the lab code repository for **DP-420** to the environment where you're working on this lab, follow these steps to do so. Otherwise, open the previously cloned folder in **Visual Studio Code**.

1. Start **Visual Studio Code**.

    > &#128221; If you are not already familiar with the Visual Studio Code interface, review the [Get Started guide for Visual Studio Code][code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted]

1. Open the command palette and run **Git: Clone** to clone the ``https://github.com/microsoftlearning/dp-420-cosmos-db-dev`` GitHub repository in a local folder of your choice.

    > &#128161; You can use the **CTRL+SHIFT+P** keyboard shortcut to open the command palette.

1. Once the repository has been cloned, open the local folder you selected in **Visual Studio Code**.

## Create an Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL account

Azure Cosmos DB is a cloud-based NoSQL database service that supports multiple APIs. When provisioning an Azure Cosmos DB account for the first time, you will select which of the APIs you want the account to support (for example, **Mongo API** or **NOSQL API**). Once the Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL account is done provisioning, you can retrieve the endpoint and key and use them to connect to the Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL account using the Azure SDK for .NET or any other SDK of your choice.

1. In a new web browser window or tab, navigate to the Azure portal (``portal.azure.com``).

1. Sign into the portal using the Microsoft credentials associated with your subscription.

1. Select **+ Create a resource**, search for *Cosmos DB*, and then create a new **Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL** account resource with the following settings, leaving all remaining settings to their default values:

    | **Setting** | **Value** |
    | ---: | :--- |
    | **Subscription** | *Your existing Azure subscription* |
    | **Resource group** | *Select an existing or create a new resource group* |
    | **Account Name** | *Enter a globally unique name* |
    | **Location** | *Choose any available region* |
    | **Capacity mode** | *Provisioned throughput* |
    | **Apply Free Tier Discount** | *Do Not Apply* |

    > &#128221; Your lab environments may have restrictions preventing you from creating a new resource group. If that is the case, use the existing pre-created resource group.

1. Wait for the deployment task to complete before continuing with this task.

1. Go to the newly created **Azure Cosmos DB** account resource and navigate to the **Keys** pane.

1. This pane contains the connection details and credentials necessary to connect to the account from the SDK. Specifically:

    1. Record the value of the **URI** field. You will use this **endpoint** value later in this exercise.

    1. Record the value of the **PRIMARY KEY** field. You will use this **key** value later in this exercise.

1. Close your web browser window or tab.

## Seed the Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL account with data

The [cosmicworks][nuget.org/packages/cosmicworks] command-line tool deploys sample data to any Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL account. The tool is open-source and available through NuGet. You will install this tool to the Azure Cloud Shell and then use it to seed your database.

1. In **Visual Studio Code**, open the **Terminal** menu and then select **New Terminal** to open a new terminal instance.

1. Install the [cosmicworks][nuget.org/packages/cosmicworks] command-line tool for global use on your machine.

    ```
    dotnet tool install --global cosmicworks
    ```

    > &#128161; This command may take a couple of minutes to complete. This command will output the warning message (*Tool 'cosmicworks' is already installed') if you have already installed the latest version of this tool in the past.

1. Run cosmicworks to seed your Azure Cosmos DB account with the following command-line options:

    | **Option** | **Value** |
    | ---: | :--- |
    | **--endpoint** | *The endpoint value you copied earlier in this lab* |
    | **--key** | *The key value you coped earlier in this lab* |
    | **--datasets** | *product* |

    ```
    cosmicworks --endpoint <cosmos-endpoint> --key <cosmos-key> --datasets product
    ```

    > &#128221; For example, if your endpoint is: **https&shy;://dp420.documents.azure.com:443/** and your key is: **fDR2ci9QgkdkvERTQ==**, then the command would be:
    > ``cosmicworks --endpoint https://dp420.documents.azure.com:443/ --key fDR2ci9QgkdkvERTQ== --datasets product``

1. Wait for the **cosmicworks** command to finish populating the account with a database, container, and items.

1. Close the integrated terminal.

## Iterate over the results of a SQL query using the SDK

You will now use an asynchronous stream to create a simple-to-understand foreach loop over paginated results from Azure Cosmos DB. Behind the scenes, the SDK will manage the feed iterator and making sure subsequent requests are invoked correctly.

1. In **Visual Studio Code**, in the **Explorer** pane, browse to the **09-execute-query-sdk** folder.

1. Open the **product.cs** code file.

1. Observe the **Product** class and its corresponding properties. Specifically, this lab will use the **id**, **name**, and **price** properties.

1. Back in the **Explorer** pane of **Visual Studio Code**, open the **script.cs** code file.

1. Update the existing variable named **endpoint** with its value set to the **endpoint** of the Azure Cosmos DB account you created earlier.
  
    ```
    string endpoint = "<cosmos-endpoint>";
    ```

    > &#128221; For example, if your endpoint is: **https&shy;://dp420.documents.azure.com:443/**, then the C# statement would be: **string endpoint = "https&shy;://dp420.documents.azure.com:443/";**.

1. Update the existing variable named **key** with its value set to the **key** of the Azure Cosmos DB account you created earlier.

    ```
    string key = "<cosmos-key>";
    ```

    > &#128221; For example, if your key is: **fDR2ci9QgkdkvERTQ==**, then the C# statement would be: **string key = "fDR2ci9QgkdkvERTQ==";**.

1. Create a new variable named **sql** of type *string* with a value of **SELECT * FROM products p**:

    ```
    string sql = "SELECT * FROM products p";
    ```

1. Create a new variable of type [QueryDefinition][docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/azure.cosmos.querydefinition] passing in the **sql** variable as a parameter to the constructor:

    ```
    QueryDefinition query = new (sql);
    ```

1. Create a new **await foreach** loop by invoking the generic [GetItemQueryIterator][docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/azure.cosmos.cosmoscontainer.getitemqueryiterator] method of the [CosmosContainer][docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/azure.cosmos.cosmoscontainer] class passing in the **query** variable as a parameter, and then asynchronously iterating over the results using the variable **product** to represent an instance of type **Product**:

    ```
    await foreach (Product product in container.GetItemQueryIterator<Product>(query))
    {
    }
    ```

1. Within the **await foreach** loop, use the built-in **Console.WriteLine** static method to format and print the **id**, **name**, and **price** properties of the **product** variable:

    ```
    Console.WriteLine($"[{product.id}]\t{product.name,35}\t{product.price,15:C}");
    ```

1. Once you are done, your code file should now include:
  
    ```
    using System;
    using Azure.Cosmos;

    string endpoint = "<cosmos-endpoint>";

    string key = "<cosmos-key>";

    CosmosClient client = new CosmosClient(endpoint, key);

    CosmosDatabase database = await client.CreateDatabaseIfNotExistsAsync("cosmicworks");

    CosmosContainer container = await database.CreateContainerIfNotExistsAsync("products", "/categoryId");

    string sql = "SELECT * FROM products p";
    QueryDefinition query = new (sql);

    await foreach (Product product in container.GetItemQueryIterator<Product>(query))
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"[{product.id}]\t{product.name,35}\t{product.price,15:C}");
    }
    ```

1. **Save** the **script.cs** file.

1. In **Visual Studio Code**, open the context menu for the **09-execute-query-sdk** folder and then select **Open in Integrated Terminal** to open a new terminal instance.

1. Build and run the project using the [dotnet run][docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-run] command:

    ```
    dotnet run
    ```

1. The script will now output every product in the container

1. Close the integrated terminal.

1. Close **Visual Studio Code**.
